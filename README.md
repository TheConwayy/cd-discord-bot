CD Discord Bot
==============

### What this Repo is for

This is the repo made for the Discord bot that helps run Conway Development.

And because we believe in open-source content. The source code is posted here.

Anything that is in the `.gitignore` file is there for confidential reasons *(such as IPs, passwords, tokens, etc)* or just stuff that is not relevant.

## Notes from the author

Please do keep in mind that this is still a **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress (WIP). Therefore, most code will not be final, and this README is not either.

*I promise the final will be a lot better than this :P*


### See you somewhere!
